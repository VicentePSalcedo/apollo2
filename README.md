- make tmux launch script for this project
2. be able to add to the lot the work type (bump-HO/QA) and the repair/warranty
to the same entry, so basically separate those fields in the entry form
    - should there be additional field for repair board count?
3. get rid of the feature that brings up the last number of boards
4. a search feature for what kind of work and who did the work
5. Add the ability to make edits to entries, so that there is no need to delete
and then rewrite entries to make changes

Now that I have the number entries a month. I need to make additional changes to the way the data is stored so that is doesn't slow down with time.
- what did you hash?
6. add the ability to clear images without clearing the entire form
